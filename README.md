# Sports-Sales2022 
(Dataset and SQL queries files are attached)

In this financial analysis project, I performed exploratory analysis to gain insights on revenue, profit, and customer satisfaction. 


I used Excel to properly clean the date for a more accurate analysis in SQL. I used simple functions such as TRIM, CONCAT, and IF. 

I then used MySQL Server to trends and actionable insights. I used functions such as ROUND, GROUP BY, and subqueries. 

Finally, I visualized the data in Tableau. The link to the dashboard is provided below.
